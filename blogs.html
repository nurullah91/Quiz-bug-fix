            <p>We can throw map, filter, forEach, find to an array. <strong>map()</strong> gives us the same code on every element in that array and returns a new array with the updated elements. <strong>filter()</strong>checks every element in that array to see if its condition get true then it returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the condition. <strong>forEach()</strong> is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it does not return anything. <strong>find()</strong> checks the condition to that array and when it got value whatever is true for the condition then it will stop searching </p>
